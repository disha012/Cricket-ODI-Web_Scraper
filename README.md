# Cricket-ODI-Web_Scraper

This is a Web Scraper which scrapes for all the cricket players who at least played one ODI match in international cricket and the runs scroed by them in individual years.

The cricket.py makes individual CSV files for all the players (Those CSV files are not uploaded here.)

The combine.py combines all these CSV files and puts all the data into a single CSV file i.e. combine.csv.

(This combining was done as I earlier didn't know that application is to be done in a particular format.)

The data is scraped from <a href="http://www.howstat.com/cricket/home.asp">howstat.com</a>
